This repository contains the code from our blog post [How to Connect Django and Postgres Using Docker and Docker Compose](https://rhonidev.com/blog/how-to-connect-django-and-postgres-using-docker-and-docker-compose).

It's a simple setup meant to help you get started with containerizing a Django project and linking it to a Postgres database. We walk through:

- Creating a base Django project
- Writing a Dockerfile for the Django app
- Adding a Postgres service
- Managing containers with docker compose
- Running migrations and checking that everything works

If you're new to Docker or just want a reference for Django + Postgres, we hope this project helps you!

Feel free to clone it, explore, and adapt it to your own needs. And if you have questions or suggestions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
